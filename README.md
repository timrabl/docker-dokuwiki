## Version / Tags

#### stable

The stable dokuwiki version without the `Ã¬nstall.php`.  
This means you need to provide a existing dokuwiki data volume to work.
This is done with:

`-v {VOLUME_NAME}:/var/www/localhost/htdocs/data`

#### stable-installer

The same version as the previous mentioned stable version, but with the `install.php`.
This means you don't have to provide a data volume but it's recommend if you want to prevent data loss.

#### rc

The *release candidate 3 ( Hogfather )* Version without the `install.php`.
As mentioned before, without the installer you need a existing data volume.
Look at the stable section to see how to do this.


#### rc-installer

As mentioned before, it's recommended to provide a data vaolume.
